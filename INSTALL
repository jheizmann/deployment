HowTo use the deployment framework
==================================


smwhalo admin utility v1.3, Ontoprise 2010

Usage: smwadmin [ -i | -d ] <package>[-<version>]
       smwadmin -u [ <package>[-<version>] ]
       smwadmin --install

        -i <package>: Install
        --install: Finalizes installation
        -d <package> ]: De-Install
        -u <package>: Update
        --dep : Check only dependencies but do not install.
        -l [ pattern ] : List installed packages.
        -r : Rollback last installation (does not work for un-installed extensions)

Examples:

        smwadmin -i smwhalo: Installs latest version of smwhalo.
        smwadmin --finalize: Finalizes every installation. Must be called after something was installed or updated.
        smwadmin -u smw: Updates the given package to the specified version. (if possible)
        smwadmin -u: Updates complete installation
        smwadmin -u --dep: Shows what would be updated.
        smwadmin -d smw: Removes the package smw.
        smwadmin -l: List all installed/available packages 

===Restore wiki from restore point===
Whenever the Deployment Framework performs one the following actions,
it offers to create a "Wiki Restore Point":
* Installing a package: smwadmin -i <package>
* De-installing a package: smwadmin -d <package>
* Updating a package: smwadmin -u <package>

You may create a restore point and do an arbitrarily number of subsequent operations. But be aware
that a new restore point will delete the old.

Call "smwadmin -r" to bring your Wiki back to the previous Wiki Restore Point.
Simply said, the Deployment Framework can undo your previous action and bring
your Wiki back to previous state (including the data, articles and
configuration).


Adding new repositories
=======================
        
File for repository links:
/deployment/tools/repositories

You may add new repositories here, the Ontoprise repo is already configured.


Using Deployment Framework with a Proxy
=======================================

Open <mediawiki-install-dir>/deployment/settings.php and set the proxy server address for
'df_proxy'. For Example: 'df_proxy' => 'proxy.example.com:8080'
