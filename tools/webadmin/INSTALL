Installation of the webadmin console:
=====================================

(1) Make sure deployment/tools/webadmin is accessible via HTTP
(2) Set the $scriptPath variable in deployment/settings.php 
    (same as $wgScriptPath in LocalSettings.php)
(3) Allow the webserver to write in 
        - deployment/tools/webadmin/sessiondata
        - LocalSettings.php
        - extensions folder (and all extensions contained)
        - deployment/tools/webadmin
        
    It is recommended to make the user which runs the webserver the owner of
    these files and directories. It can be a different webserver than used for the wiki.    
        
(4) Allow the webserver/PHP to run external PHP processes (normally granted per default).
(5) For wiki authentication make sure that the 'curl' PHP-extension is installed.
    Otherwise authentication by wiki is not possible and you have to configure a separate
    user. Take a look in deployment/settings.php for that.
(6) If you want to upload bundles you have to enable uploads in your webserver conf. 
    You can configure the upload directory in settings.php. Otherwise uploads 
    are stored in $HOME/df_upload or $TEMP/df_upload if $HOME is not defined.
(7) If you want to restore from a restore point the whole wiki directory
    must be writable by the webserver.        

You get a warning if something is missing when you first access the webadmin console.

There is a settings file located at deployment/settings.php. Take a look in it,
it is documented. It contains some configuration concerning the webadmin console.
