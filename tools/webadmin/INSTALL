Installation of the webadmin console:
=====================================

(1) Make sure deployment/tools/webadmin is accessible via HTTP
(2) Set the $scriptPath and $df_lang variable in deployment/settings.php to your wiki location
    (same as $wgScriptPath and $wgLang in LocalSettings.php)
(3) Change the wiki name in deployment/settings.php. Do not use spaces or 
	special characters since it is used as a directoy name. Underscores are OK.
(4) Configure a home directory in deployment/settings.php if $HOME or %HOME% is not defined
	for the user which runs the webserver.
(5) Allow the webserver to write in 

        - deployment/tools/webadmin/sessiondata
        - LocalSettings.php
        - extensions folder (and all extensions contained)
        - deployment/tools/webadmin
        - deployment/tools/repositories
        - /usr/share/local/Ontoprise (optional, only required if you plan to install external apps like TSC)
        
    It is recommended to make the user which runs the webserver the owner of
    these files and directories. It can be a different webserver than used for the wiki.    
        
(6) Allow the webserver/PHP to run external PHP processes (normally granted per default in PHP).
(7) For wiki authentication make sure that the 'curl' PHP-extension is installed. 
    Otherwise authentication by wiki is not possible and you have to configure a separate
    user solely for DF-GUI. Take a look in deployment/settings.php for that:
    
	    public static $df_authorizeByWiki = false;
		public static $df_webadmin_user = "root";
		public static $df_webadmin_pass = "pass";
	
	In case of wiki authentication all Wiki sysops are allowed to use the DF-GUI.
	
(8) If you want to upload bundles you have to enable uploads in your webserver conf and in php.ini. 
    You can configure the upload directory for DF-GUI in settings.php. Otherwise uploads 
    are stored in $HOME/df_upload. If that does neither work, error is thrown. 
    Note: The upload directory for DF-GUI is not the same as used for the webserver conf!
(9) If you want to restore from a restore point the whole wiki directory
    must be writable by the webserver. ( see (4) )  
    Make also sure that the database credentials $wgDBadminuser and $wgDBadminpassword 
    are both set in LocalSettings.php.

You get a warning if something is missing when you first access the webadmin console.

There is a settings file located at deployment/settings.php. Take a look in it,
it is documented. It contains some configuration concerning the webadmin console.

Troubleshooting:
================

If you followed the instructions and it still does not work, try to enable the 
error reporting by uncommenting the following two lines at the beginning 
of deployment/tools/webadmin/index.php:

----
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', "On");
----

Now you should get an error message which might help.
