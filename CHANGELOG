Since Wiki admin tool 1.6.0 (renamed, formerly known as DF) 

New: 

  - Compatible with MW 1.17 (but not with < 1.17)
  
  - repositories file location has changed. It is now located at config/repositories
  
  - settings.php is now shipped in the config/ directory. It must be configured and then 
    copied to the root directory of the wiki admin tool (the former location).
  
  - Wiki server administration. A new tab 'Server' in Wiki Admin tool web-GUI allows starting/stopping the servers. 
    It is automatically configured when using the Windows installer. Otherwise the user has to do some manual adjustments. This is documented at deployment/tools/webadmin/README.
    
  - LocalSettings.php can be edited as a whole in Wiki Admin tool web-GUI (Settings tab), not only the sections individually.
  
  - Patches for an extensions are automatically re-applied if an extension is installed again (via update or via -f). 
    It can also be forced by the user to re-apply patches of an extension with the command: --applypatches <ID>
    
  - There are no more hash values used on bundle pages. If a page is overwritten or not is decided by the save comment. 
    If this is not "auto-generated by Wiki admin tool" the page is considered to be edited manually. 
    
  - Minor usablitiy improvements (explanation texts, different layout)
