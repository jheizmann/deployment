 1. Global metadata.
 
    Contains global metadata of a package. 
 
 Example:
 
        <global>
                <version>120</version>   // means 1.2
                <patchlevel>1</patchlevel> // default if missing is 0
                <id>smwhalo</id>      
                <instdir>extensions/SMWHalo</instdir>
                <vendor>Ontoprise</vendor>
                <maintainer>Ontoprise</maintainer>
                <description>... any text ...</description>
                <dependencies>
                    <dependency from="100" to="120">ID of an extension</dependency>
                </dependencies>
                <helpurl>http://...</helpurl>
                <license>GPL-v2</license>
                <notice>... any text ...</notice>
        </global>
        
        - version: 3 digits
        - patchlevel: integer beginning with 0 which is default.
        - id: unique name for package (all lowercase)
        - installation directory (only slashes, no backslashes to be platform-independant)
        - vendor: Arbitrary name
        - maintainer: Arbitrary name
        - description: A short text which describes the package
        - dependencies: Describes all packages which this package needs for proper working.
                    the dependant package is identified by its ID. from and to attributes 
                    specify the range of versions of the dependant package which this package can handle.
        - a help URL which is shown in the rendered repository view. 
        - license hint: Gives a hint for the license of this deployable. Arbitrary string. 
        - notice: A notice for the user which is shown when the installation process has finished. Arbitrary string. 
                    
2. Codefiles (this is OPTIONAL, can be empty)
    
    Used for checking integrity of code. All denoted files are hashed, concatenated to a string and this
    is finally hashed resulting in the fingerprint of this code.
    
    This hash value can be created by using the maintenance tool: createDesc.php
    
    <codefiles hash="371f01255099a64cad6d0a92ccc8ed60">
        <file loc="..."/>
        <file loc="..."/>
    </codefiles>
    
        - hash attribute: Accumulated hash of all specified files.
        - file element: may point to a single file or a directory. 
    
3. Wikidumps/ontologies

    Specifies dump files containg arbitrary wiki pages. It's a special dump format containing
    a hash to determine changes to the wiki pages. This special export can be created by using
    the maintenance tool: export 
    
    <wikidumps>
        <file loc="..."/>
        ...
    </wikidumps>
    
    Specifies ontologies which should be imported. The common ontology serialization formats are supported:
        rdf/xml, n3, nt.
    
     <ontologies>
        <file loc="..."/>
        ...
    </ontologies>
    
4. Resources

    Specifies resources to either import or just to copy. The location attributes can point 
    to files or directories. If a dest-attribute is specified the files contained in location
    will only be copied in place.
    
    <resources>
        <file loc="..."/>
        ...
    </resources>
    
    Note: If you add content of any kind to your extension you should add a notice to inform the
          user to refresh the semantic content. This notice is shown at the end of an 
          installation procedure. Creating a notice is quite simple. Just add the following tag
          to the global section:
          
          <notice> ... your notice ... </notice>
    
5. Configs

    Specifies the necessary configuration changes. It is divided in three sections:
    
        - new: Executed if a package is installed completely new
        - update: If a package is updated (from the given version)
        - uninstall: Executed if the package is de-installed.
    
    <configs>
        <new>
        </new>
        <update from="...">
        </update>
        <uninstall>
        </uninstall>
    </configs>    
     

     In every configuration section the following elements can appear:
     
        - variable: A variable 
        - function: A function call
        - require: A require statement
        - php: Arbitrary PHP code
        
        - patch: A patch file which needs to be executed
        - script: A script which needs to be executed 
        
6. Configuration elements
        
        *All config elements must contain a name attribute. 
        *They may contain a remove attribute. This indicated that the specified element should be removed.
        *They may contain a description attribute.
        
       - variable: 
                    <string>, <boolean>, <number>, <array>
                    where array can contain the others and itsself of course.
                    Each can contain a key attribute, if they are contained in an array.
                    In this case it became a hash array.
                    
                    Example:
                    
                    <variable name="wgUseAjax">
                        <boolean name="wgUseAjax"
                            description="enables ajax calls">
                            true
                        </boolean>
                    </variable>
                    
       - function:  <string>, <boolean>, <number>, <array>
                    where array can contain the others and itsself of course.
                    They serve as function call arguments.
                    
                    Special attributes: null (indicates the value NULL)
                    
                    Example:
                    
                    <function name="enableSMWHalo">
                        <string name="sql_storage">SMWHaloStore2</string>
                        <string name="ts_storage" null="true" />
                        <string name="ts-url" null="true" />
                    </function>
                    
       - require: file attribute points to the script file.
       
                    Example:
                    
                    <require name="smwhalo"
                        file="extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_Initialize.php" />
                        
       - php: No special attributes
       
                    Example:
                    
                    <php name="somecode">$arbitraryCode = 2323;</php>
       
       - patch: attribute file: A file in the unified patch format (GNU)
       
        Example:
            <patch file="patch_for_SF2.0.8.txt" ext="semanticforms" from="208" to="208" />
            
       - script: attribute file: A PHP script.
       
        Examples:
            <script file="maintenance/SMW_setup.php" />
            <script file="maintenance/SMW_setup.php" params="--delete" />
