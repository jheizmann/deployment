The deploy framework repository is a HTTP accessible endpoint of the following structure:

    (1) A respository.xml file
    (2) A extensions directory containing a subdirectory for every deployable entity 
        The directory is named with the ID of the extension. The directory contains all available
        deploy descriptors named after the following schema: deploy-<ver>.xml where <ver> is a 
        3-digit version number. It also contains a file deploy.xml pointing to the latest deploy
        descriptor, ie. the one with the highest version number.
        
 example:

    - repository.xml
    - extensions 
     | 
     |-smwhalo
       |
       |- deploy-130.xml
       |- deploy-140.xml
       |- deploy.xml
     |-smw
     |-haloacl
     
     

The repository may use HTTP Basic Authentication for access restriction.

Repository.xml format:

    <root>
        <extensions>
            <extension id="extension>
                <version ver="130" patchlevel="3" url="http://..."/>
                <version ver="140" patchlevel="2" url="http://..."/>
            </extension>
        </extensions>
    <root>    
    
Each extension has its own <extension> node. For each version there is one version node below containg the 
version number and the patchlevel. The url attribute specifies where the bundle can be downloaded. Any 
HTTP location is possible.

Version numbers are always 3-digit numbers, patchlevels is an integer number >= 0. A missing patchlevel
attribute is interpreted as 0.
