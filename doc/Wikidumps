1. Format

   The wikidumps use basically the same XML format than Mediawiki does. But it was extended slightly
   
    1. A version attribute for each page
    2. A part-of-bundle attribute
    3. A hash attribute
    
2. Create dump

    A dump has to contain two special annotations (english, for other language see language files):
            
       Ontology version
       Part of bundle    
       
    They should be contained in a template which is embedded in each page conataining to
    the bundle. The exporter reads these attribute values and adds them in the dump. It also
    creates a hash value about the text content and stores it in the attribute 'Content hash'.
    
    Use maintenance/export to create such a dump.
    
3. Import dump

    When a dump is imported, the hash value is read and added as annotation to the page. By default
    it is not visible in the rendered text but in the factbox.
    
    Dumps are imported using either maintenance/import or (better) the smwadmin tool.
